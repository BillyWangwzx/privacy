<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>Juan Manuel Altamirano (”Company”, “I”, “my”, “me”) provides this Privacy Policy to explain how it collects, stores, and uses the information collected in connection with Developer’s software applications and games. Company respects the privacy of their users and is committed to protecting the user’s information. You have a right to know my practices regarding the information I may collect and use when you use my services.</p>
    
<h1>The types of information I collect and how I collect it</h1>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>- Company collects the advertising identifier (Apple’s IDFA and Google’s advertiser ID) , and a unique identifier for each user in my mobile games.<br>
- Company integrates third party SDKs in to my services. These SDKs are used for advertising to my users, analyzing service usage, enabling in-app purchases, or providing game services including  achievements, leaderboards, and account management. I allow third party operators this collected data solely for internal operations of the service as permitted by applicable rules and laws. This could include, but is not limited to, persistent advertising identifiers, geolocation information, and IP address. I encourage you to review the policies of the third party operators listed below.<br>
- Some of my services require or allow a user to provide a screen name so they can be identified within the service.</p>

<h2>Non-personal Information</h2>

<p>- I allow third parties to collect some information by which users cannot be identified. Non-personal information may include technical information about your device, such as your browser type, screen resolution, device type, language, type of operating system and geo location (only general location). Non-personal information is gathered by third party services while you are accessing the service. They are allowed to use this information to conduct research and analysis, but only for strictly limited purposes. I encourage you to review the policies of the third party operators listed below.<br>
Internally, Company also reserves the right to collect anonymous information for research and analysis. This information is generic in nature and cannot be used to individually identify a user. This information is collected each time a user runs one of my services.</p>

<h1>What I do with the personal information I collect</h1>

<p>- Advertisers collect data regarding advertisement performance, user’s interaction with ads, my apps and user’s interests. Collected data may include user’s personal information in order to serve users ads and for the third parties’ legitimate business interests.<br>
- When a service asks for a username, it is used to visually identify that user to other users playing the game. Company prohibits any user under the age of 13 from providing individually identifiable information in their username or screen name. This includes, but is not limited to the user’s first name, last name, email address, and physical address.</p>

<h1>What I do with the non-personal information I collect</h1>

<p>- Third party operators are allowed to collect and use non-personal information to conduct research and analysis, or to target advertisements, or other limited purposes. This information cannot be used to individually identify any user. I encourage you to review the policies of the third party operators listed below.</p>

<h1>How to opt-out of targeted advertising</h1>

<p>If you would like to opt-out of interest-based advertising, you may do so in your mobile device’s settings. On iOS, this can be done by turning on the Limit Ad Tracking option under Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising. On Android, this can typically be found under Settings -> Google -> Ads -> Opt out of Ads Personalization, although the exact location of this setting may differ depending on your device make and Android version.

<h1>Children under the age of 13</h1>

<p>I understand the importance of protecting the privacy and safety of children using my services. Company collects, uses, and discloses data from kids in the same way as for other users, as described in this policy. Game use of all data is limited to support operations of the Game. If you are a parent of a child under 13 years of age and you believe your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me using the information below and I will delete the information from my systems at hi@thepangry.com</p>

<h1>Disclosure of Personal information</h1>

<h1>Security</h1>

<p>I follow generally accepted industry standards and internal procedures to protect personal information submitted to me, both during transmission and once I receive it.</p>

<h1>Third-party Operators</h1>

<p>- Advertising Networks: Company allows advertisements from the Third Party ad networks to be displayed in my services. Company makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the third party ad networks are configured to comply with applicable privacy laws, and I reasonably believe this to be the case for each of them. If I determine a service to be directed at children under the age of 13, I configure each of these ad networks to be compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). For persons in European Union countries, I also configure networks to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation of 2016 (GDPR).<br>
- In-App Purchases: In order to make in-app purchases, a user must use a third party checkout options that I have integrated with my services to finalize and pay for their order. The third party operator’s privacy policy and security practices will apply to this process a user’s information. I encourage you to read that privacy statement before providing your information.<br>
- Game Services: Many of my services integrate either Apple Game Center or Google Play Game Services. Each of these third-party operators offer their own privacy policy (listed below), and I encourage you to review them.<br>
- Analytics: Company makes use of Third Party service in order to measure how users utilize my services so that I may improve them.</p>
